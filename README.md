# Math Magicians
Math magicians is a website for all fans of mathematics. It is a Single Page App (SPA) that allows users to  make simple calculations and read a random math-related quote.


This project is part of the Microverse curriculum module 3. The main objective is to understand how create a React app, use class based-components, hooks, state, run tests, and creating professional documentation for development.

Clone this repository or download the Zip folder:
```
https://github.com/AACHOURMOHAMED/math-magicians.git
```

To get started, In the project directory, you can run:
```
yarn install OR npm install
```
run react app and open in browser:
```
yarn start OR npm start
```
Runs the app in the development mode.\

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
